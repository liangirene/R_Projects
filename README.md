# R Project Compilation

## Project: IBTrACS Trend Analysis
- This project entails the study of attributes amd volume of tropical storm occurances observed in the North Atlantic Storm Basin. The data comes from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) website.
- The data types for the 16 imported columns are as follows:
  - `SEASON`, `NUMBER`, `WMO_WIND`, `WMO_PRES`, `DIST2LAND`, and `LANDFALL` must be of type "integer"
  - `LAT` and `LON` must be of type "double" or "real"
  - The rest of the columns must be of type "character"

## Project: Data Visualization (Screen Time & Cal Women's Basketball)
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in data visualization, and has 2 distinct components: 
- Replicate iPhone screen time's barchart and improve its visualization 
- In our analysis of the Cal Women's Basketball 2021-2022 Game-by-Game Scores data, we aim to identify the crucial factors that contribute to victory in basketball games. By closely examining Cal's performance throughout the season, we can uncover the correlation between scoring points and successful shooting. To visualize this relationship and its impact on game outcomes, we have created a scatterplot. This graphic effectively represents the points scored by the Cal Women's Basketball team on the x-axis, while the y-axis represents Cal's field goal percentage. Furthermore, we have color-coded the data points based on the game's outcome: green for a win and red for a loss for Cal.

## Project: Investment Simulator 
This project consists of two main components:
- In the first section, we focused on defining important financial math formulas such as future value and ordinary annuity. In addition, we conducted 50 simulations of a 10-year investment period in a Total Stock Market index fund. To enhance understanding and analysis, we created a comprehensive timeline visualization for these simulations.
- In the section section, we leveraged the previously defined formulas to develop an investment simulator through the use of a **Shiny** app. This interactive application enhances the user experience and facilitates practical exploration of investment scenarios.
