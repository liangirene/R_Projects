## Project: Data Visualization (Screen Time & Cal Women's Basketball)
This project has 2 elements: 
- Replicate iPhone screen time's barchart and improve its visualization 
- In our analysis of the Cal Women's Basketball 2021-2022 Game-by-Game Scores data, we aim to identify the crucial factors that contribute to victory in basketball games. By closely examining Cal's performance throughout the season, we can uncover the correlation between scoring points and successful shooting. To visualize this relationship and its impact on game outcomes, we have created a scatterplot. This graphic effectively represents the points scored by the Cal Women's Basketball team on the x-axis, while the y-axis represents Cal's field goal percentage. Furthermore, we have color-coded the data points based on the game's outcome: green for a win and red for a loss for Cal.
